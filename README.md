# Rainsweeper
!! EPILEPSY WARNING !!

This is a minesweeper - a game in which you have to find all the mines using your logic. 
Left-click to open a cell, right-click to mark it as a mine (hold a cell in mobile version). You can choose difficulty with different size of field and amount of mines. If you will click to cell with a number and the amount of arrouding unopened cells equals the number, the cells will open automatically.
You can undo your last step by using the eponymous button or by pressing ctrl+z. You can also reveal the field, restart game or create new one.
It is possible to scale the game by your mouse wheel on the PC version and by pinch-zoom on the mobile version. The field is also draggable by two fingers on mobile and using ctrl+leftclick on desktop.
There is two game modes which you can switch with "NP" button. The first (which is active by default) generates usual field, but there you can stuck in situations when you actually can't be 100% sure that mine in the certain place. So you can use second game mode in which you always have the field that you can solve only by your logic. No 50/50. But please make note that this setting is in development, so now it works kinda bad for medium and hard game mod because from time to time it takes veeeery long time to generate the field.
  
Enjoy playing the game!
