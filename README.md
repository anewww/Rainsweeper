# Rainsweeper

This is a minesweeper - a game in which you have to find all the mines using logic. 
Left-click to open a cell, right-click to mark it as a mine. You can set the field size (amount of cells by x coordinate and y coordinate) and amount of mines (by default: 22x22, 70 mines).
You can undo your last step by using eponymous button or by pressing ctrl+z. You can also reveal the field, restart game or create new one.
Each additional block is movable (by dragging it from the top of the block).
  
Enjoy playing the game!
